## Introduction
This folder contains a few exercides with answers about writing your first TestCafe tests.  
The folder also contains a simple set up for TestCafe which can be run locally and with the Sauce Labs
[`saucectl`](https://docs.saucelabs.com/testrunner-toolkit)-runner.

## Setup  

---
### Sauce Labs setup
1. Free [Sauce account](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up)
2. Make sure you know how to find your Sauce Labs Username and Access Key by going to the [Sauce Labs user settings page](https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings)

---
### Node.js.  

You can install Node.js from the node.js website: 

https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 

Or using Node Version Manager (NVM): https://npm.github.io/installation-setup-docs/installing/using-a-node-version-manager.html 

The current version is 18. And any new version from 14+ should be fine 

To check if Node was installed, open a terminal and run the command:    
```bash
node -v
```
and: 
```bash
npm -v
``` 
---
### JavaScript IDE.  

I'm using VSCode. But you can use any editor such as WebStorm, or Atom 

---
### TestCafe.  

Install TestCafe package globaly by running the command:

```bash
npm install -g testcafe
``` 
check it was installed by running the command:
```bash
testcafe -v
``` 
---
### GitHub setup

1. Sign up for a free [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
2. [Fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
 * Make sure you are logged into GitHub
 * Click the Fork in the upper right of the GitHub.
 * Give the repo a ⭐ while you're here 🤩
3. Instead of forking this repository, you can clone the project by opening a new terminal and using the following command:   
 `git clone https://github.com/eyaly/testcafe-sauce-workshop.git`
  
---
### Install dependencies
- Make sure you are in the root of the project
- Install all dependencies by running the following command in the terminal
  
  `npm install`
  
  This will install all dependencies, including the `saucectl`-runner

## The Workshop 
- You can find in [this](https://github.com/eyaly/testcafe-sauce-workshop/tree/main/tests/specs/workshop) folder an 'exe' folder and an 'answers' folder.   
- The [exe](https://github.com/eyaly/testcafe-sauce-workshop/tree/main/tests/specs/workshop/exe) folder contains TestCafe exercises. In each file, you will find instructions on what you need to do and how to run the tests locally on your machine
- The [answers](https://github.com/eyaly/testcafe-sauce-workshop/tree/main/tests/specs/workshop/answers) folder, contains the solution and the code for the exercises.

## Run tests locally
The project also contains [this](https://github.com/eyaly/testcafe-sauce-workshop/tree/main/tests/specs/sauceDemoWebApp) folder with tests that you can run locally and on SauceLabs.   
To run the tests on your local machine, the only thing you need to have is Chrome. If you have it you can run this 
command in a new terminal

    testcafe chrome tests/specs/**/*spec.*

It will run all tests in your local Chrome browser.

## Run tests in Sauce
To run the examples, use the `saucectl`-command and select a configuration. This can be done by opening a terminal and type in the 
following command:

```shell
# For the EU DC, where `#` is the number of the example
npx saucectl run -c ./.sauce/config-ex#.yml
     
# For the US DC, where `#` is the number of the example
npx saucectl run -c ./.sauce/config-ex#.yml --region us-west-1
```
   
> **Note:** `npx` is used here because `saucectl` is one of the `devDependencies` in this project. When `saucectl`
    > is installed globally (with `npm install -g saucectl`) then you can use `saucectl` without the `npx prefix`

> **Note:** To see all options that `saucectl` is providing type in `npx saucectl --help` and in [Sauce Labs doc](https://docs.saucelabs.com/web-apps/automated-testing/testcafe/yaml/)


### Examples
All below mentioned examples can be found in the [`.sauce`](./.sauce)-folder. You can run the configurations by running
the following command from the root of this folder

```shell
# By default all configs run on the EU DC, if you run `saucectl` directly from the command line and you
# want to run on the US DC then add `--region us-west-1` at the end
npx saucectl run -c ./.sauce/config-ex#.yml
```

> **Note:** The `#` stands for the number of the below mentioned examples.

### Example 1 - Minimal configuration for all tests
`config-ex1.yml` provides a minimum configuration needed to run the TestCafe tests.
In this example, all tests are executed on a single chrome browser in sequential order.

### Example 2 - Parallel tests
`config-ex2.yml` breaks apart the execution of the tests such that they can run in parallel on separate chrome browsers.

### Example 3 - Cross Browser tests
`config-ex3.yml` run the login tests on:
- Windows 10 with Chrome, Firefox and MicroSoftEdge
- MacOS 11 with Safari, Chrome, Firefox and MicroSoftEdge

### Example 4 - Run on iOS simulators
`config-ex4.yml` run all tests on iOS simulators

> **Note:** More options can be found in the
> [TestCafe on Sauce Labs](https://docs.saucelabs.com/testrunner-toolkit/configuration/testcafe) documentation 

### Special Note on Sauce Connect Tunnels
Using `saucectl` does _not_ automatically start a Sauce Connect tunnel, which may be advantageous if you want to use an existing tunnel, or if you do not require a Sauce Connect tunnel with your TestCafe tests. 

If you would like to run tests with an existing Sauce Connect tunnel, use the flag `--tunnel-name` like this

```
saucectl run --tunnel-name myTunnel 
```

or see the above section on the TestCafe on Sauce Labs documentation.
